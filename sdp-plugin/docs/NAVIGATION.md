## Quick Start

### 3 Essential Commands

```bash
# 1. Plan a feature
@feature "Add user authentication"

# 2. Execute workstream
@build 00-001-01

# 3. Quality check
@review F01
```

That's it! Everything else builds on these three commands.

## Decision Trees

### Tree 1: Feature Development Workflow

```
START: I want to build a feature
│
├─ Is it a NEW feature with unknown requirements?
│  └─ YES → @feature "Description"
│     (Progressive disclosure: vision → requirements → planning → execution)
│
├─ Do you have clear requirements but need to plan workstreams?
│  └─ YES → @design idea-name
│     (Interactive planning with EnterPlanMode)
│
├─ Do you have workstreams ready to execute?
│  └─ YES → @build 00-001-01
│     (TDD discipline with progress tracking)
│
└─ Do you want autonomous execution (no human intervention)?
   └─ YES → @oneshot F01
      (Spawns orchestrator agent, runs workstreams autonomously)
```

**See Also:** [Workflow Comparison](docs/workflow-decision.md)

---

### Tree 2: Quality & Review

```
START: I need to check code quality
│
├─ Is it a completed feature?
│  └─ YES → @review F01
│     (Multi-agent review: QA + Security + DevOps + SRE + TechLead + Docs)
│
├─ Did you find a bug in production?
│  └─ YES → @issue "Bug description"
│     (Analyzes severity, routes to @hotfix or @bugfix)
│
├─ Is code failing tests unexpectedly?
│  └─ YES → /debug "Test failure description"
│     (Systematic debugging: scientific method)
│
└─ Do you need to validate quality gates manually?
   └─ YES → Check docs/quality-gates.md
      (Coverage ≥80%, files <200 LOC, type hints, etc.)
```

**See Also:** [Quality Gates Reference](docs/quality-gates.md)

---

### Tree 3: Execution Strategy

```
START: How should I execute workstreams?
│
├─ Need real-time progress visibility?
│  └─ YES → @build 00-001-01
│     (TodoWrite tracking, Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle)
│
├─ Want hands-off execution?
│  └─ YES → @oneshot F01
│     (Autonomous orchestrator, checkpoint/resume support)
│
├─ Need to coordinate multiple features?
│  └─ YES → @feature "Description"
│     (Manages multi-feature orchestration)
│
└─ Just testing/prototyping?
   └─ YES → Use @build or @oneshot (same, but no Beads tracking)
```

## Debugging

### Systematic Debugging Workflow
Use `/debug` for unexpected failures:

```bash
/debug "Test fails unexpectedly"
```

**Debugging Process:**
1. **Observe** - Gather evidence (logs, error messages)
2. **Hypothesize** - Formulate hypotheses
3. **Test** - Verify hypotheses experimentally
4. **Fix** - Apply root cause fix
5. **Verify** - Confirm fix works

## FAQ

### Q: When should I use @build vs @oneshot?
**A:** Use `@build` for real-time progress visibility and hands-on control. Use `@oneshot` for autonomous execution without intervention. See [Decision Tree 3](#tree-3-execution-strategy).

### Q: What's the difference between @feature and @design?
**A:** `@feature` is the **unified workflow** (vision → requirements → planning → execution). `@design` is just the **planning phase** - use it when you already have requirements but need to break down into workstreams.

### Q: Do I need Beads CLI?
**A:** Recommended for team collaboration and multi-session work. Optional for single-developer projects. See [Workflow Comparison](docs/workflow-decision.md).

### Q: How do I get help?
**A:** Use `@help` or `claude help` to see available commands and get interactive guidance.
