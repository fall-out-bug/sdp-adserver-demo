# Example: Multi-Agent Epic

A complete example of using Multi-Agent mode for a larger feature.

## Scenario

Add a complete user notification system: users can set preferences, receive notifications via email and in-app, and view notification history.

## Setup

```
docs/specs/epic-notifications/
├── epic.md
└── consensus/
    ├── artifacts/
    ├── messages/inbox/{agent}/
    └── decision_log/
```

## Epic Definition

### docs/specs/epic-notifications/epic.md

```markdown
# Feature: User Notification System

## Business Need
Users need to receive notifications about important events (order updates,
security alerts, marketing) through their preferred channels.

## High-Level Requirements
1. Users can set notification preferences (email, in-app, push)
2. System sends notifications through selected channels
3. Users can view notification history
4. Users can mark notifications as read
5. Admin can send broadcast notifications

## Success Metrics
- 80% of users set preferences within first week
- <5 minute delivery time for critical notifications
- <1% unsubscribe rate

## Timeline
Target: 3 weeks
```

## Agent 1: Analyst

### Session

```
Read prompts/analyst_prompt.md
Analyze docs/specs/epic-notifications/epic.md
Create detailed requirements
```

# Requirements: User Notification System

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Notification Preferences
- FR-1.1: User can enable/disable email notifications
- FR-1.2: User can enable/disable in-app notifications
- FR-1.3: User can enable/disable push notifications
- FR-1.4: User can set quiet hours (no notifications during period)
- FR-1.5: Preferences persist across sessions

### FR-2: Notification Delivery
- FR-2.1: System routes notifications based on user preferences
- FR-2.2: Critical notifications bypass quiet hours
- FR-2.3: Failed deliveries are retried (3 attempts)
- FR-2.4: Delivery status is tracked

### FR-3: Notification History
- FR-3.1: User can view last 100 notifications
- FR-3.2: User can filter by type (order, security, marketing)
- FR-3.3: User can mark individual notifications as read
- FR-3.4: User can mark all as read

### FR-4: Admin Broadcast
- FR-4.1: Admin can send notification to all users
- FR-4.2: Admin can send to segment (by preference)
- FR-4.3: Broadcast has scheduling option

## Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-1: Delivery within 5 minutes for normal, 1 minute for critical
- NFR-2: Support 10,000 concurrent notifications
- NFR-3: 99.9% delivery success rate
- NFR-4: Notification history loads in <500ms

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to control how I receive notifications so I'm not overwhelmed
2. As a user, I want to see my notification history so I don't miss anything
3. As an admin, I want to broadcast announcements to all users
```

```

## Domain Model

### Notification
- id, user_id, type, title, body, priority
- created_at, read_at, delivered_at

### UserPreferences
- user_id, email_enabled, inapp_enabled, push_enabled
- quiet_hours_start, quiet_hours_end

### DeliveryChannel (enum)
- EMAIL, IN_APP, PUSH

## Key Decisions

### Async Processing
Notifications queued for async delivery to handle scale.
See ADR-0008.

### Preference Caching
User preferences cached in Redis (5 min TTL) to reduce DB load.
See ADR-0009.

## API Endpoints

### User Endpoints
- GET /api/notifications - list user's notifications
- PUT /api/notifications/:id/read - mark as read
- GET /api/preferences - get notification preferences
- PUT /api/preferences - update preferences

### Admin Endpoints
- POST /api/admin/notifications/broadcast - send broadcast

## Database Schema

### notifications
- id, user_id, type, title, body, priority
- created_at, read_at
- INDEX on (user_id, created_at)

### notification_preferences
- user_id (PK), email_enabled, inapp_enabled, push_enabled
- quiet_hours_start, quiet_hours_end

### notification_deliveries
- id, notification_id, channel, status, attempted_at, delivered_at
```

### ADRs Created

- `docs/adr/0008-async-notification-queue.md`
- `docs/adr/0009-preference-caching.md`
