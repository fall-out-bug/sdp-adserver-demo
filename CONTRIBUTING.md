## Contribution Guidelines

### For Documentation

- Write in clear, concise English
- Include examples where helpful
- Keep formatting consistent with existing docs
- Test any code examples you include

### For Command Prompts

When adding or modifying command prompts in `prompts/commands/`:

1. **Follow the existing structure** - Use the format with sections like ALGORITHM, PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS, etc.
2. **Keep language-agnostic** - Don't hardcode specific technologies (use placeholders like `{language}`, `{framework}`)
3. **Include all required sections**:
   - GLOBAL RULES - Core principles
   - ALGORITHM - Step-by-step workflow
   - OUTPUT FORMAT - What to display to user
   - THINGS YOU MUST NEVER DO - Hard constraints
4. **Test with actual AI tools** - Verify the prompt works with Claude Code or Cursor

### For New Commands

To add a new slash command:

1. Create `prompts/commands/{command}.md` (full prompt)
   - Include RECOMMENDED @FILE REFERENCES section
   - Document TodoWrite usage if applicable
   - Add Composer examples if multi-file editing needed
2. Create `.cursor/commands/{command}.md` (quick reference for Cursor IDE)
3. Add skill to `.claude/skills/{command}/SKILL.md` (Claude Code integration)
   - Document Task tool usage if autonomous execution
   - Document AskUserQuestion if interactive
   - Document EnterPlanMode if planning phase
4. Update `README.md` and `README_RU.md` with command description
5. Update `MODELS.md` with model recommendation
6. Update `docs/guides/CURSOR.md` and `docs/guides/CLAUDE_CODE.md` if needed

### Code Style

- **English only** - All content must be in English (except README_RU.md)
- **Consistent formatting** - Follow existing Markdown style
- **No trailing whitespace**
- **End files with newline**

## Using SDP for Your Contributions

You're welcome to use SDP workflow for larger contributions:

### For Larger Changes (new features, major refactors)

1. **Requirements** - Run `/idea "{description}"` to create draft
2. **Design** - Run `/design idea-{slug}` to create workstreams
3. **Implement** - Run `/build WS-XXX-XX` for each workstream
4. **Review** - Run `/review F{XX}` to verify quality
5. **Deploy** - Run `/deploy F{XX}` when ready

**Recommended tools:**
- [Claude Code](docs/guides/CLAUDE_CODE.md) - CLI with multiple providers
- [Cursor IDE](docs/guides/CURSOR.md) - Visual IDE with slash commands

See [MODELS.md](MODELS.md) for model selection.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** - If your change affects usage, update relevant docs
2. **Write clear commit messages** - Describe what and why
3. **One feature per PR** - Keep changes focused
4. **Reference issues** - Link to related issues in PR description

### PR Title Format

```
type: brief description

Examples:
- docs: add Python project example
- feat: add /refactor command
- fix: correct path in /build prompt
```

### PR Description Template

```markdown
## Summary
