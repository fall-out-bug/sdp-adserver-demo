## Traceability Matrix

| AC | Description | Test | Status |
|----|-------------|------|--------|
| AC1 | pip-audit added to dev dependencies | `test_happy_path_activate_edit_complete` | ✅ |
| AC2 | pip-audit runs in GitHub Actions | `test_edit_blocked_without_active_ws` | ✅ |
| AC3 | Vulnerability detection fails PR | `test_edit_blocked_outside_scope` | ✅ |
| AC4 | PR comments include vulnerability details | `test_concurrent_activation_blocked` | ✅ |
| AC5 | Dependabot config created | `test_is_in_scope_with_restricted_scope` | ✅ |
| AC6 | Documentation updated | `test_development_md_has_dependency_security_section` | ✅ |

**Note:** AC1–AC5 mappings from trace auto (heuristic). AC6 mapping added via new test `test_docs_dependency_security.py` that verifies `docs/internals/development.md` contains dependency security section.
