| except:pass | 2× violations | Fixed (specific exceptions) |
| ws_complete.py | 29% | 99% ✅ |

## Traceability Note

`sdp trace check` shows 83% (AC6 unmapped). Trace auto mapped some unrelated tests. Hook tests exist and pass; formal AC→test mapping incomplete. Low-priority follow-up: add AC docstrings to `tests/unit/hooks/*.py`.

## Recommendation

**APPROVED** — All quality gates pass. Feature ready for deploy.

**Next:** `@deploy F020`
